## Notes from this project

I always forget how to spin up a python server on this machine. Listing below.
python -m http.server

We are using something called Phaser, which is a free, open source game framework. (https://phaser.io/)

**Game Loop** - Core of every game. What allows update of game logic and rendering of graphics for every frame.

In Phaser, game loop is handled automatically via **game states**. A game state can be thought of as one "screen."

Actually... I feel like this isn't a great way for me to learn something. I need to come up with my own idea at this point and start making it.
